## About the Game

In "The King's Library," players navigate a virtual library environment to find and read books containing historical facts about how King James I patronized Shakespeare's company (renamed from Lord Chamberlain's Men to The King's Men), and how Shakespeare's plays like Macbeth reflected the king's interests in Scotland and witchcraft.

This project aims to make historical learning engaging and interactive, allowing students to discover the fascinating connection between royal patronage and theatrical development in early 17th century England.
